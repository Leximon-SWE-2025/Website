                <p>Leximon is a top-down turn-based battle game where players use their knowledge of synonyms and antonyms to win against the computer-controlled enemies. Victory will allow the player to level up and gain access to new words. In order to keep the game exciting, the player will be presented with a random selection of words that they know. Due to the structure of the game, students can fight a few battles during their breaks at school or sit down for longer sessions of Leximon during their free time.</p>

                <h1>Project Background</h1>
                <p>Leximon was designed for students who are in the latter end of elementary school. We wanted to create a game that would reinforce their learning about synonyms and antonyms of different words.</p>
