                <h1>Leximon</h1>
                <p>This game is a top-down turn-based battle game where players use their knowledge of synonyms and antonyms to defeat computer-controlled enemies. Players attack or defend by selecting a synonym or antonym from a list of words depending on the category of word, or type, which is assigned to the player or enemy. Using an antonym to the enemy’s type results in an effective attack, and using a synonym to the player’s type results in an effective defense.</p>
                <p>By defeating enemies the player may level up and gain access to new words, ensuring a sense of progression and teaching new vocabulary. Students may fight a few battles during their breaks at school or sit down for longer sessions of Leximon during their free time, all the while having fun as they learn synonyms and antonyms.</p>

                <h1>Project Background</h1>
                <p>One of the key linguistic concepts students learn near the end of elementary school is synonyms and antonyms. These constructs can greatly enhance students’ ability to identify and define new vocabulary words. For many people it is easier to understand the meaning of a word if presented with a synonym or antonym than when presented with its definition. Synonyms are crucial for creating variation in writing and can often make the difference between boring and interesting literature.</p>
                <p>We chose to create a game which presents students with an opportunity to practice identifying synonyms and antonyms in a fun and engaging way. We also chose the language of Pokémon-like battles for our gameplay since these games have proved popular for children (and adults), making it easy for students to understand how to play.</p>
